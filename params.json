But, unlike other general courses, CSE199 course provides more interesting and comfortable studying environment. So, I have always been satisfied with this course.\r\n\r\n##Various ways to learn\r\n###1. Video\r\nThis course provides a unique way to study \"Video\". In my opinion, it's a great way, since people usually have better concentration on watching video than any writings. Thus, \"Video\" is good teaching method.\r\n###2. Class Activity\r\nUnlike, other boring classes, this course provides a lot of useful and interesting activity, such as creating one's web pages, playing many kinds of games and making something to understand how internet works etc....\r\n###3. Taking Video\r\nThis class sets taking video tasks. Since starting point of semester, I have taken three videos based on the provided \"Video\". In my opinion, it is not only appropriate way to check student whether or not understand the contents of videos, but also, students enable to review that videos easily.\r\n\r\n###These are my videos assignments\r\n1. ![First](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rbegacTW658/default.jpg?sqp=CNiOvsIF&rs=AOn4CLB3nvP22OjB7bAtTD9s6ZaRPfsgLw)[First Video - Basic of Internet Network Structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbegacTW658)\r\n2. ![Second](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ttUq0qBpato/default.jpg?sqp=CNiOvsIF&rs=AOn4CLClvsOSGWcCuqAJRgKwozRu01MAbg)[Second Video - What is URL & URI?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_KepNJ2jDA)\r\n3. ![Third](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3_KepNJ2jDA/hqdefault.jpg?custom=true&w=196&h=110&stc=true&jpg444=true&jpgq=90&sp=68&sigh=yQsxrv4yr9FJMjwKfLUW62UGM-0) \r\n\r\n##Course Instructors\r\n### Professor Geoffrey Challen\r\n![Instructor](https://photos.smugmug.com/Years/2014/14213-Engineering-Geoffrey/i-fV2nDKL/0/S/3X5A6950-S.jpg)\r\n### Professor Jesse Hartloff\r\n![Instructor](https://i1.rgstatic.net/ii/profile.image/AS%3A279610202836995@1443675675238_l/Jesse_Hartloff.png)",
