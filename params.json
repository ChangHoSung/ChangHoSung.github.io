But, unlike other general courses, CSE199 course provides more interesting and comfortable studying environment. So, I have always been satisfied with this course.\r\n##Various ways to learn\r\n###1.Video\r\nThis course provides a unique way to study \"Video\". In my opinion, it's a great way, since people usually have better concentration on watching video than any writings. Thus, \"Video\" is good way to deliver what the course want to teach.\r\n###2.Class Activity\r\nThis course provides a lot of useful and interesting activity.\r\n##Course Instructors\r\n### Professor Geoffrey Challen\r\n![Instructor](https://photos.smugmug.com/Years/2014/14213-Engineering-Geoffrey/i-fV2nDKL/0/S/3X5A6950-S.jpg)\r\n### Professor Jesse Hartloff\r\n![Instructor](https://i1.rgstatic.net/ii/profile.image/AS%3A279610202836995@1443675675238_l/Jesse_Hartloff.png)",
